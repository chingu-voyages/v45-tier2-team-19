## 🌍 Overview

This app was developed as a part of the 6-week [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) Voyage 45 in August and September 2023. The app uses data from [NASA's Open Data Portal Meteorite Landings dataset](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh). According to the NASA Open Data Portal, "This comprehensive data set from The Meteoritical Society contains information on all of the known meteorite landings."

The goals for this project included:

- To create a purely frontend application using the NASA data.
- To use any language, tool, or library to plan, design, and build the app.
- To build the app without the use of AI-base solution generators like GitHub CoPilot.
- To build a minimally viable product (MVP) that includes a landing page with:
  - A scrollable detail data display showing the meteorite strike history
  - Search fields allowing users to customize a detail data display
  - A summary metrics component showing the data graphically

## ✨ Features
